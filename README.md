In this project, we download daily created domains list from whoisds.com using getDomains.py file, and then we run splitFiles.py file to split the domains list into smaller files.
Then we run deneme.sh to get the status codes, redirected final urls and contents of the domains. We store the datas in MongoDB Atlas localhost.
